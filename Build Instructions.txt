To build ppm_one, you have to build the common library and the lmmin library first.

I recommend that you use cmake to install. There are also build scripts called "build.sh"
which you may use to build with the code as well.

1.  cd into the build_common directory ($ cd build_common)
2.  Edit the build.sh script to use whichever compiler you want. Right now, we are using
    the PGI compiler for its GPU support. If you want to use the PGI compiler with GPUs,
    you may have to change the value of "-ta=tesla:cc70" to represent which GPU you are
    using. You may also use "-ta=multicore" to compile for multicore CPU.
3.  Run the build.sh script. ($ . ./build.sh)
4.  Run "make install". ($ make install)
5.  cd back and into the build_lmmin directory ($ cd ../build_lmmin)
6.  Again, you may want to edit the build.sh file to fit your needs.
7.  Run the build.sh script. ($ . ./build.sh)
8.  Run "make install". ($ make install)
9.  cd back to the main directory ($ cd ..)
10. Edit the final build.sh script.
11. Run "make install". ($ make install)

The executable will be generated in the ppm directory. ($ cd ppm)

ppm_one can be run with a few different options. The only one that is accelerated
is the standard options.

An example of running the code:
$ ./ppm_stable -pdb example.pdb
